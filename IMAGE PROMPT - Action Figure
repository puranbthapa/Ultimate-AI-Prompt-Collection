Create a realistic action figure toy of [YOUR NAME].
The action figure should be posed mid-action, [INSERT POSE OR ACTION – e.g., lifting a dumbbell with one arm, holding a coffee cup, mid-dance move]. The figure is wearing [INSERT OUTFIT – e.g., gym gear, business suit, festival outfit, etc.], including [OPTIONAL: ADD ACCESSORIES – e.g., sunglasses, chains, watch].

Packaging Details:
The card behind the blister is [INSERT BACKGROUND COLOR – e.g., light red, electric blue, neon green] and includes subtle background graphics that reflect your personality or profession (e.g., circuits for techies, stars for dreamers, books for writers).
At the top of the box, write: [YOUR NAME]
Underneath, in smaller letters: [TAGLINE OR TITLE – e.g., "AI Explorer Action Figure", "Marketing Pro Edition", "Chaos Coordinator"]
Add the phrase: "[CATCHPHRASE – e.g., Build with AI, Just One More Rep, Always Be Creating]" on the card, near the bottom.

Accessories (each inside their own individual blister next to the figure – list 3 to 4):
[ITEM 1 – e.g., a barbell, microphone, pen]


[ITEM 2 – e.g., pets, coffee cup, gaming controller]


[ITEM 3 – e.g., book titled "X for Dummies", laptop]


[OPTIONAL EXTRA – e.g., robot, musical instrument, food item]



Everything (the figure and the accessories) should be enclosed in individual plastic blisters, mounted on the custom-colored card backing, just like a real collectible action figure. The design should feel authentic, fun, and made for the shelf.

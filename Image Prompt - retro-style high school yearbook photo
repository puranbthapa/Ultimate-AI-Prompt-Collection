Create a retro-style high school yearbook portrait of the person in the uploaded photo.

**Superlative:** “[Insert yearbook title – e.g. Class Clown, Most Likely to Ghost You, Teacher’s Pet]”

**Era & Style:** “[Choose one – 1980s, 1990s, or early 2000s]. Reflect the fashion, hairstyles, photo quality, and lighting from this decade. Include era-specific color tones and styling.]”

**Pose:** “[Choose a pose – awkward smile, peace sign, head tilt, serious face, arms crossed, stiff upright posture, etc.]”

**Outfit:** “[Describe the outfit clearly – hoodie, letterman jacket, polo layers, flannel, band tee, butterfly clips, chokers, etc.]”

**Vibe:** “[Choose a high school archetype – cool loner, class clown, theater kid, future coder, walking meme, teacher’s pet, etc.]”

**Hair & Accessories:** “[Describe hairstyle – spiked hair, feathered bangs, crimped, gelled. Add accessories like chokers, scrunchies, big earrings, braces, glasses, etc.]”

**Background:** “[Choose a yearbook-style backdrop – cloudy blue studio, laser grid, gym wall, lockers, chalkboard, library bookshelves, etc.]”

**Text Overlay:** Add a stylized name and superlative in retro yearbook font. Use white or yellow serif or script font placed in a dark strip across the bottom of the image. Example: ‘Jordan Smith – Most Likely to Ghost You.’

**Layout Style:** “[Choose one: Portrait Mode (standard yearbook photo) or Yearbook Page Mode (photo on a printed page with margins, grain, page number, and other ghosted portraits)]”

**Visual Effects:**
- Film grain or scanner noise
- Slight image softness or blur to simulate old print
- Warm (80s) or cool (90s) tint depending on the decade
- Slight color fading, low contrast
- VHS scanlines or dust specks
- Optional: scribbles, sticker overlays, “HAGS” autograph, Lisa Frank-style decor, or pen doodles (e.g., drawn-on glasses, devil horns)

**Final Output Style:** Make it look like a scanned photo from a real high school yearbook from the selected era. Combine a mix of nostalgia, awkward charm, and light visual wear. The face should clearly resemble the person in the uploaded photo but styled to match the decade.

Generate a portrait-oriented image of a realistic, full-glass gashapon capsule being held between two fingers. Inside the capsule is a chibi-style, full-figure miniature version of the person in the uploaded photo.
The chibi figure should:
Closely resemble the person in the photo (face, hairstyle, etc.)

Wear the same outfit as seen in the uploaded photo

Be in a pose inspired by the chosen theme

Include accessories or props that fit the theme (e.g. skateboard for a skate theme, controller for a gamer theme, mic for music, etc.)

The capsule should look clear, glossy, and realistic, with subtle reflections and refractions that enhance its miniature feel.
 The background should be soft or blurred to keep the focus on the capsule.

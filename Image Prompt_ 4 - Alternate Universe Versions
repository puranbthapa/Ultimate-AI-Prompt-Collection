You are a creative visual artist assistant trained to generate imaginative alternate universe versions of a person using AI image tools. The final result should be 4 images in a collage format, each showing a different version of the same person in a wildly different multiverse reality. Each version should reflect a distinct vibe, personality, and world.
Create a 4-panel image collage showing 4 different alternate universe versions of me, each with a unique personality and aesthetic. Each version should look like me but reflect a completely different timeline and backstory.
Use these 4 versions:
Evil Me – A dark, powerful villain from a dystopian future. Think sci-fi warlord or shadowy overlord. Menacing, dramatic lighting, futuristic armor or dark robes.


Rockstar Me – A global music icon in the middle of a concert. Electric guitar, wild hair, glam or grunge outfit. Stage lights and cheering crowd in the background.


Astronaut Me – A noble space explorer in a high-tech suit. Standing on a distant alien planet, looking heroic. Futuristic space backdrop, stars and nebulae behind.


Medieval Ruler Me – A powerful king/queen or knight from a fantasy realm. Wearing ornate armor or royal robes, sword or staff in hand, castle or battlefield behind them.


Make sure each version:
Has a distinct background, outfit, and mood.


Keeps facial features similar so it's recognizably the same person.


Feels cinematic and vibrant — ready to be posted on social media.


Optional: Add a fun label to each quadrant of the collage (e.g. “Evil Me”, “Rockstar Me”, etc.).

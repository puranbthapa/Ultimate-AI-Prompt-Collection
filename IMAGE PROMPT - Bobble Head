Bobble Head Image Prompt

"Create a highly detailed, realistic bobblehead figure based on the uploaded photo of the user.
 The bobblehead should perfectly capture the user's real facial features, hair color, hairstyle, skin tone, and overall expression — but in an exaggerated, fun style typical of collectible bobbleheads.
Key characteristics:
The head should be noticeably oversized compared to the small body, about 2.5x larger in proportion, with a slight 'spring' base visible at the neck.


The facial features must be clearly recognizable and finely detailed, maintaining the realism of skin textures, eye shape, smile lines, and hair strands.


The body should be small and cartoonish but accurately dressed in the same clothes the user is wearing in the uploaded photo (or matching the style if exact replication isn't possible).


The pose should be cheerful and playful — for example, the bobblehead could be standing with one hand waving or giving a thumbs up.


The finish should look like high-quality hand-painted resin, with slight glossiness on the surface to simulate the traditional bobblehead material.


The background should be clean, neutral (white or light grey) to make the bobblehead the main focus.


Lighting should be soft and even, giving the entire figure a polished, studio-photographed look.


Emphasize friendly, lively, and vibrant colors while staying faithful to the original image details."


Optional Extras (depending on user's preference):
Add a small round base plate under the figure (with the user's first name written in fun lettering if needed).


Slight cartoon-style outlines around the figure to enhance the bobblehead aesthetic.


2nd Prompt
Prompt for Bobblehead + Box Packaging:
"Create a highly detailed, realistic bobblehead figure based on the uploaded photo of the user, displayed inside a custom bobblehead-style box packaging.
Bobblehead figure details:
The bobblehead must capture the user's real facial features, hairstyle, skin tone, and outfit as shown in the uploaded image, but in a fun, slightly exaggerated style.


Head size should be about 2.5x larger than the small body, connected with a visible spring at the neck.


Face should show lively, expressive details — realistic skin texture, eyes, mouth, and hair, but adapted slightly to the cheerful bobblehead style.


Clothing should match the user's outfit exactly or be artistically interpreted in a matching style.


The bobblehead should have a high-quality hand-painted resin look — semi-glossy finish with soft, even studio lighting.


Packaging (box) details:
The bobblehead should be standing inside a colorful collectible box (similar to a Funko Pop box) with a clear plastic front window showing the full figure.


The box should have a bold, playful design, customized to match the user — use bright colors that complement the user’s outfit or personality.


Include a cartoon version of the user's face in the bottom corner of the box as part of the packaging design.


Add text: the front of the box should feature a large, fun font with the user's first name or nickname (e.g., 'Steve's Bobblehead!').


The sides of the box should include small profile art (side view of the bobblehead) and a stylized logo if possible.


Box background inside can be simple — soft gradients or patterns matching the theme.


Lighting should highlight both the figure and the box, with reflections on the plastic window to make it look like a real physical boxed item.


Final mood:
Fun, lively, colorful, and professional, like a real collectible you’d find in a store.


Highly realistic bobblehead figure, combined with a stylized packaging mockup."



Optional Add-ons you can include (depending on style you want):
A "Special Edition" sticker on the box (gold or silver foil look).


An extra accessory inside the box (like a tiny replica of something user is holding in the original photo — e.g., coffee cup, skateboard, laptop, etc.).


Background inside the box themed to the user's favorite color or a cartoon-style cityscape.

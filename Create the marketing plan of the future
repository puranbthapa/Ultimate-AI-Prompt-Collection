From first principles, develop a detailed, well-researched, and well-reasoned AI-powered marketing strategy tailored to a [company type] that wants to thrive over the next 5 years.
📌 Examples to customize:
[company type] → “B2B SaaS company,” “bootstrapped ecommerce startup,” “mid-size legal firm,” “freelance design collective,” etc.



Organize all marketing tasks and workflows into three core categories:
✅ All Done by AI – Fully automated tasks where humans are (or will soon be) unnecessary

🤝 AI + Human – AI generates the first draft; humans optimize, edit, and deploy

🧠 Human Only – Deeply human tasks AI won’t master (e.g. relationship-building, vision)



Cover the entire marketing funnel, including (but not limited to):
Audience research

Content creation

SEO + SEM

Email + CRM campaigns

Paid ads

Social media

Branding + creative strategy

Funnel optimization

Lead nurturing + sales enablement

Reporting + performance analysis



For each task in each bucket, outline:
🧩 What the task is and why it fits this category


🛠️ Best tools or AI models (current or upcoming)
 e.g., Jasper, Claude, GPT-5, HubSpot AI, Surfer, Deepseek, ChatGPT+Browse


🔄 How to implement or transition to this model

⚠️ Risks/blind spots (e.g., hallucinations, legal/regulatory risks, brand tone mismatch)

📈 How to measure success (KPIs, cost/time savings, output quality, team satisfaction)



🧪 Bonus Customization Ideas:
 Let users personalize the strategy based on these optional fields:
🎯 Target audience (e.g. “enterprise buyers in healthcare”)

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team size and skill level (e.g. “3-person team with basic AI experience”)

⚙️ Current stack (e.g. “using Notion, HubSpot, Canva, and Ahrefs”)

🪙 Budget level (e.g. “low-cost, high-leverage strategy”)



📌 Final Objective:
 The output should be a clear, forward-looking roadmap that helps [company type] decide:
Where to automate confidently
Where to collaborate with AI
Where to retain a uniquely human edge

"I am going to train you to become an Endless Idea Generation Machine.

Here's how it works: there are 4 types of ideas we can generate.



The 4 primary types of ideas are:

- Actionable
- Analytical
- Aspirational
- Anthropological



Then there are sub-topics within each of these buckets:

Actionable (here's how)

- Tips
- Tools
- Hacks
- Advice
- Resources
- Frameworks
- Ultimate Guides
- Curation (the best books/podcasts/threads)



Analytical (here's a breakdown)

- Trends
- Numbers
- Reasons
- Examples
- Teardowns
- Swipe files


Aspirational (yes, you can)

- Lessons
- Mistakes
- Reflections
- Personal stories
- Stories of growth
- Underrated traits
- Advice to past self

Anthropological (here’s why)

- Fears
- Failures
- Struggles
- Paradoxes
- Observations
- Comparisons
- Why others are wrong
- Why you’ve been misled



I am going to give you a Topic, an audience (FOR WHO), and an outcome that audience desires (SO THAT), and you are going to generate 1 idea (written in the form of a headline) for each of these sub-topics above—organized the same way I have here.



Do you understand?

If so, ask me for my topic, the target audience of the content, and the outcome we're going to help them achieve with the content

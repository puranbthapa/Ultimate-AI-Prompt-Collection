Update with your business details and requirements

Context:
I run a platform that connects people who need help with skilled individuals who can assist. Our goal is to enhance the post-purchase experience for customers by making it easy to access helpful services (like installation, setup, delivery assist, etc.).

What I Offer:
For product-based businesses, we offer:

A co-branded landing page linking to relevant services

Custom vouchers or incentives to encourage use

Tailored visuals and messaging based on product categories

These integrations help their customers get extra support and create a smoother buying experienceâ€”while also driving growth for the business.

Promotion Options Include:

Pre-purchase product pages

Post-purchase emails

On-delivery inserts/flyers

What I Need From You:
Find 15 businesses that meet the following criteria:

Sell physical products that may require post-purchase support (e.g., setup, install, delivery help)

Could benefit from offering add-on service options to customers

Are primarily located in [insert your region] or key markets

For each business, list:

Name

Description

Contact person + email

Website

Size/stage of company

Product types

Why this business would be a good fit for partnership

Final Deliverable:
Organize these businesses into a dashboard segmented by:

Product category (e.g., furniture, home electronics, fitness gear)

Service need (installation, delivery help, setup, etc.)

How well they align with the platform

Estimated partnership readiness
